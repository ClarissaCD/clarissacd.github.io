        <h4>DISCLAIMER:</h4>
        <p>The following showcases three WordPress websites I developed. For each project, I handled the development 
          using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, along with libraries such as Animation on Scroll and Lightbox. I did
           not design these sites but focused on implementing the given designs. Additionally, I developed the 
           website hosting this portfolio to highlight my work.</p>

        <h2>Teacher Certification Website</h2>   
        <p>This project had playful accents and shapes that represent early education throughout the website. A big focus
          during development was ensuring that the images and accents could be switched out with ease without a need to go 
          back to the design phase. I've included screenshots of the website on mobile that show the accents and shapes 
          remained consistent and responsive.

          <h2>Urban Planning Website</h2>   
          <p>This project was for an urban planning company that wanted to have their projects easily accesed throughout
            the website. The projects were added in one area on the back-end and populated in atleast the home and 
            project-type page. The project sliders in the first screenshot could be placed anywhere on the website through 
            one reusable block and the project-type(s) could be selected with a dropdown. This work was done in order to 
            reduce the amount of times project plans and images needed to be uploaded

        <h2>Realty Website</h2>   
        <p>This project was for a new realty group and I have been helping maintain their website for months. They 
          have about a dozen properties at a time and this affects how they present them. As they grow we have added
          pagination features and created the ability for them to use filters in the future. In the screenshots below,
          you can see how they present properties in modals but we also have static pages for each property that are 
          shared with interested parties.
