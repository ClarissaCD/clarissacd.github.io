        <h2>Tiny Restaurant</h2>   
        <p>As part of my Google UX Design courses, I tackled the Tiny Restaurant project 
          with a focus on business concepts rather than just problem-solving. During the 
          ideation phase, I explored the concept of a small restaurant with a unique selling
           point, guided by a prompt to create a mobile app. This led to brainstorming ways 
           the business could stand out. From there, I moved into the research phase, gathering 
           insights from diverse user backgrounds. Finally, in the wireframing and mockup phase
           , I refined my designs through early testing. Below, you’ll find my wireframes and 
           low-fidelity prototypes.

         <h2>Fund</h2>   
         <p>As part of my undergrad, I worked on a capstone project where we created a hypothetical application that helped young 
          adults and recent grads manage their funds. We researched what other applications offered and created user personas to 
          think of what features the hypothetical app would need. We created some low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity 
          mock-ups for the app. The available presentation deck summarizes our work.

         <h2>VSCO Redesign</h2>   
         <p>When I was learning about computer and user interaction, I redesigned the photography mobile
           app VSCO in an effort to improve its usability. One of the major issues I have with VSCO's 
           interface is that its studio page edits pictures from your gallery unless you click through 
           several buttons to make a copy to edit. In my redesign, you'd upload a picture from your gallery
            you can edit without harming the original.<br> 
          The other issue that I resolved with the same screen was the placement of the camera icon in VSCO.
           In the original VSCO screen, the camera is in the upper right corner. In the redesign, the camera is 
           accessible when you choose to add a picture to your studio. It looks cleaner on screen and is intuitive
            for mobile users.<br>
          The third issue I had with VSCO's original design was that its user search page and its image search 
          were separate. Most platforms make searching their platform easy and use filters to differentiate
           users from images. I feel that VSCO already does a good job with its tabs as filters, so its separate
            search pages are not necessary. In my redesign, I combined the search pages.<br>
