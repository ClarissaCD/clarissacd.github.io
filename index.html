        <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio.</h1>   
        <p>I'm Clarissa, a designer with a strong foundation in graphic design, web development, and a growing focus on user experience.
           My journey started in graphic design, where I first learned the importance of responsiveness—how designs need to adapt across 
           different mediums, from web to print. As I transitioned into web development, I began to notice more about the user journey 
           and the challenges that users face, particularly in terms of accessibility.</p>
        <p>For instance, while working on projects, I’ve seen how details like font size, weight, color, and spacing can significantly impact users with conditions such as dyslexia or color 
           blindness. Sometimes, design choices like small or thin fonts seem appealing at first, but once put into practice, they can
            become difficult to read and inaccessible. These experiences have sparked my passion for UX, driving me to create more intuitive 
            and user-friendly designs.</p>
        <p>I'm eager to continue growing my skills in crafting digital experiences that work well for everyone. Feel free to explore my past projects through the menu links or download 
          my resume to dive deeper into my skills and experience.</p>
